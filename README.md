# PokedexProject

This app is called Pokédex, and it allows users to look up statistics and information for over 800 Pokémon. When clicked on, each Pokémon has a details page that lists some of their attributes, such as their Attack, Defense, and Speed. The app allows users to freely switch between a table view and a grid view of the Pokémon. It also has a search functionality, where users can search by name for specific Pokêmon to filter the list down.

This is the home screen page. The Pokémon are listed in a table view, and there is a grid button that allows the user to switch views. There is also a search bar at the top so that the user can filter the Pokémon.

This is the grid view for the user to view the Pokémon. Again, the user has the option to switch back to a table view.

This is an example of the search functionality. Here, the user filters the Pokémon so that all the Pokémon that have "J" names appear.
